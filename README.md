# Code-Quiz

## Description

The purpose of this project was to create a code quiz with a timer that behaves like so:

The application has a few multiple choice questions and the ability to store top scores on the user's device. Once the user clicks "Start", question and options of answers appears, but they are penalized 15 seconds if they answer a question incorrectly. The final score is based on the amount remaining on the timer.

At the end of the quiz (when the user answers all questions or time is up), upon viewing their score, the user is able to enter their initials to add their score to the High Scores list. Once they enter their initials, the scoreboard will appear with an option to clear the board or restart the quiz.
